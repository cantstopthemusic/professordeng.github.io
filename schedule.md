Today is July 25. I've been recording knowledge in my blog, but now I find I'm wrong. It's too slow to do that. Knowledge should be kept in mind but not in my blog, so I need to change my plan.

## 1. time management

In order to concentrate my energy, I use time slice scheduling algorithm to manage my time. the method is similar to Pomodoro Technique. this management is based on my personal situation. The reasons are as follows.

1.  Physical and Mental fatigue

   I can keep learning for about an hour, but after that my brain becomes inactive, and my eyes begin to wear out.

2. Aesthetic fatigue

   I think it is awful to keep learning the same course hour and hour.

so I will do one task in forty minutes, and then take a 10-minute break before the next task.

## 2. less notes, more understanding

I think it is necessary to take notes when you study. Because humans tend to halve their memory of newly learned knowledge in a matter of days or weeks, unless they consciously review the learned material. so notes are the best review materials. 

Notes must be short and effective, which just help you to remember what you learn. SO, less notes, more understanding.
